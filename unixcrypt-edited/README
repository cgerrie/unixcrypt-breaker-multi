		    Break unix "crypt" encryption

				* * *

SUMMARY

 unixcrypt-breaker is an automated tool for breaking the encryption of
 the old unix crypt(1) utility.  It can guess substantial portions of
 the plaintext without previous knowledge of the key.

INSTALLATION

 For instructions on compiling and installation, see the file INSTALL.

USAGE EXAMPLE

 Suppose file.cpt is a file encrypted with crypt(1), and plain1,
 plain2, plain3 are large representative plaintext files of a similar
 type. First, sample the plaintext files using the command

  unixcrypt-breaker -s /tmp/stats.txt -c plain1 plain2 plain3

 This will write some statistical information about the plaintext
 files to the file /tmp/stats.txt.  Then, decrypt file.cpt with the
 following command:

  unixcrypt-breaker -s /tmp/stats.txt file.cpt

 The output is written to file.cpt.guess.

USAGE

 For detailed usage information, see the man page.
